G - CRB and String
CRB has two strings s and t.
In each step, CRB can select arbitrary character c of s and insert any character d (d ≠ c) just after it.
CRB wants to convert s to t. But is it possible?
Input
    There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer T, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case there are two strings s and t, one per line.
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
1 ≤ |s| ≤ |t| ≤ 105

    All strings consist only of lowercase English letters.
    The size of each input file will be less than 5MB.
Output
    For each test case, output "Yes" if CRB can convert s to t, otherwise output "No".
